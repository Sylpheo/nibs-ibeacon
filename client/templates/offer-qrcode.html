            <p><strong>As the name already implies, our Lust & Laune Rosé offers pure pleasure. A cuvée consisting mainly of Zweigelt and Pinot Noir, it is widely versatile either as an accompaniment for snacks or as a liquid complement to relaxed discussions.</strong></p>
            <p>*Clear, lustrous pink-rosé, fine fragrance of fresh red fruits,  highlighted by subtle spicy nuances, in equal measure fresh  and fruity on the palate, altogether very well-rounded, lively  and exhilarating, offering immense drinking pleasure.</p>
            <p>*Excellent with snacks, but also goes superbly with salmon  and all that can be conjured up from it.</p>
